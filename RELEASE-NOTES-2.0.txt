CHANGED COLLECTIONS:
--------------------

LRUMap
------
    
LRUMap has been reimplemented as a subclass of 
SynchronizedHashMap.  The new implementation of
LRUMap should be faster, and it also offers true LRU 
capabilities; now any get(Object) or 
put(Object,Object) from this collection
promotes the key to the Most Recently Used position.
    
LRUMap 2.0 compatibility changes: 
  - LRUMap can no longer be cast to a HashMap.
  - The removeLRU() method now has a different 
    signature, and is no longer public.  There is
    no direct replacement for this method.
  - "Externalized" LRUMap 1.0 Objects cannot be
    read by LRUMap 2.0.
        
New features:
  - True LRU algorithm.
  - New methods from SequencedHashMap superclass.
  - processRemovedLRU(Object key, Object value) method
    allows subclasses to perform custom actions on 
    keys and values that are expunged from the Map.
        
Bugs fixed:
  - calling setMaximumSize(int) will remove excess LRUs
    when the current size of the Map exceeds the new
    maximum size
