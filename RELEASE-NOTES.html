<center><h2>RELEASE NOTES: COLLECTIONS 3.3</h2></center>

<p>
Commons collections is a project to develop and maintain collection classes
based on and inspired by the JDK collection framework.
This project is JDK1.2 compatible, and does not use JDK1.5 generics.
</p>
<p>
This release adds various new classes and fixes a number of bugs.
All feedback should be directed to commons-user at jakarta.apache.org.
</p>
<hr />

<center><h3>COMPATIBILITY</h3></center>
<p>
This release is fully source and binary compatible with v3.2.
(Checks performed using JDiff and Clirr, thanks).
Please check the bug fixes to ensure you weren't relying on the behaviour of a bug.
</p>
<p>
One bug was that the ExtendedProperties was hiding properties with empty 
property values. It is possible you could have been depending on that feature. 
See [COLLECTIONS-238].
<p>
There are xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx new <i>deprecations</i>:<br />
If this causes major headaches to anyone please contact commons-dev at jakarta.apache.org.
