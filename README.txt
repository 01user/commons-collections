Jakarta Commons Collections
===========================

Welcome to the Collections component of the Jakarta Commons
project.

This component requires the excellent Ant utility.  It can 
be found here :

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

For testing the project, you will also need JUnit :

  http://www.junit.org/

To let the test process find JUnit, you may make a 
copy of the build.properties.sample file, rename to
build.properties,  and modify to reflect
the location of the junit.jar on your computer.
