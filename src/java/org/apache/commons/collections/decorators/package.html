<p>
This package contains collection implementations that decorate other collections.
A decorator wraps a class and adds some specific additional functionality.
<p>
The following decorator types are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>Synchronized - synchronizes method access for multi-threaded environments
<li>Unmodifiable - ensures the collection cannot be altered
<li>Predicated - ensures that only elements that are valid according to a predicate can be added
<li>Typed - ensures that only elements that are of a specific type can be added
<li>Blocking - blocks until data available when calling get() on an empty collection
<li>FixedSize - ensures that the size of the collection cannot change
<li>Lazy - creates objects in the collection on demand
<li>Ordered - ensures that insertion order is remembered in a Map/Set
</ul>
<p>
Each collection can be constructed using a static <code>decorate()</code> method on
the class. They can also be constructed from the <code>XxxUtils</code> class where
Xxx is the collection type.
<pre>
List stringOnlyList = TypedList.decorate(new ArrayList(), String.class);
List otherStringOnlyList = ListUtils.typedList(new ArrayList(), String.class);
