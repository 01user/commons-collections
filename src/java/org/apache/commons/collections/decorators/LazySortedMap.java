/**
 * <code>LazySortedMap</code> decorates another <code>SortedMap </code>
 * to create objects in the map on demand.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link #get(Object)} method is called with a key that does not
 * exist in the map, the factory is used to create the object. The created
 * object will be added to the map using the requested key.
 * <p>
 * For instance:
 * <pre>
 * Factory factory = new Factory() {
 *     public Object create() {
 *         return new Date();
 *     }
 * }
 * SortedMap lazy = Lazy.sortedMap(new HashMap(), factory);
 * Object obj = lazy.get("NOW");
 * </pre>
 *
 * After the above code is executed, <code>obj</code> will contain
 * a new <code>Date</code> instance. Furthermore, that <code>Date</code>
 * instance is mapped to the "NOW" key in the map.
