/**
 * Provides a base decorator that enables additional functionality to be added
 * to a Map via decoration.
 * <p>
 * Methods are forwarded directly to the decorated map.
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not perform any special processing with
 * {@link #entrySet()}, {@link #keySet()} or {@link #values()}. Instead
 * it simply returns the set/collection from the wrapped map. This may be
 * undesirable, for example if you are trying to write a validating
 * implementation it would provide a loophole around the validation.
 * But, you might want that loophole, so this class is kept simple.
