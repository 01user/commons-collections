/**
 * A <code>Map</code> implementation that maintains the order of the entries.
 * In this implementation order is maintained is by original insertion.
 * <p>
 * This implementation improves on the JDK1.4 LinkedHashMap by adding the 
 * {@link org.apache.commons.collections.MapIterator MapIterator}
 * functionality, additional convenience methods and allowing
 * bidirectional iteration. It also implements <code>OrderedMap</code>.
 * <p>
 * The <code>orderedMapIterator()</code> method provides direct access to a
 * bidirectional iterator. The iterators from the other views can also be cast
 * to <code>OrderedIterator</code> if required.
 * <p>
 * All the available iterators can be reset back to the start by casting to
 * <code>ResettableIterator</code> and calling <code>reset()</code>.
 * <p>
 * The implementation is also designed to be subclassed, with lots of useful
 * methods exposed.
