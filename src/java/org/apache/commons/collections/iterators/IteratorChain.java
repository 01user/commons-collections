/**
 * <p>An IteratorChain is an Iterator that wraps one or
 * more Iterators.  When any method from the
 * Iterator interface is called, the IteratorChain will
 * proxy to a single underlying Iterator.  The 
 * IteratorChain will invoke the Iterators in sequence until 
 * all Iterators are exhausted completely.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together
 * in this manner is more efficient (and convenient)
 * than reading out the contents of each Iterator into a
 * List and creating a new Iterator.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Calling a method that adds new Iterator<i>after
 * a method in the Iterator interface
 * has been called</i> will result in an
 * UnsupportedOperationException.  However, <i>take care</i>
 * to not alter the underlying List of Iterators.</p>
