<p>
This package contains implementations of the
{@link org.apache.commons.collections.Bag Bag} and 
{@link org.apache.commons.collections.SortedBag SortedBag} interfaces.
A bag stores a object and a count of the number of occurences of the object.
<p>
The following implementations are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>HashBag - implementation that uses a HashMap to store the data
<li>TreeBag - implementation that uses a TreeMap to store the data
</ul>
<p>
The following decorators are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>Synchronized - synchronizes method access for multi-threaded environments
<li>Unmodifiable - ensures the bag cannot be altered
<li>Predicated - ensures that only elements that are valid according to a predicate can be added
<li>Typed - ensures that only elements that are of a specific type can be added
<li>Transformed - transforms each element added to the bag
</ul>
