<p>
This package contains implementations of the BidiMap, OrderedBidiMap and SortedBidiMap interfaces.
A BidiMap is an extension to Map that allows keys and values to be looked up with equal ease.
One example usage is a system communicating to a legacy datasource that must convert codes
from the new format to the old format and vice versa.
<p>
The following implementations are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>DualHash - uses two HashMaps to implement BidiMap
<li>DualTree - uses two TreeMaps to implement SortedBidiMap
<li>Tree - red-black tree implementation of OrderedBidiMap
<!--
<li>Synchronized - synchronizes method access for multi-threaded environments
<li>Unmodifiable - ensures the collection cannot be altered
<li>Predicated - ensures that only elements that are valid according to a predicate can be added
<li>Typed - ensures that only elements that are of a specific type can be added
<li>Transformed - transforms each element added
<li>FixedSize - ensures that the size of the map cannot change
<li>Lazy - creates objects in the map on demand
<li>ListOrdered - ensures that insertion order is retained-->
</ul>
