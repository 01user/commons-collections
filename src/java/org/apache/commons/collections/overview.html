     Commons-Collections contains implementations, enhancements and utilities
     that complement the Java Collections Framework.
  </p>
  <p>
     The Apache Jakarta Commons Collections Framework component adds a significant
     amount of enhancements to the standard JDK collections. These enhancements
     come in the form of new interfaces, new implementations and utility classes.
  </p>
  <p>
     See also the <code>java.util</code> package for the standard Java collections.
  </p>
     
  <h4>Main features</h4>
  <p>
     Commons-Collections defines a number of key interfaces:
  </p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr bgcolor="#CCCCFF" class="TableHeadingColor">
    <th>Interface</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.Bag}
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A new <code>Collection</code> subinterface that stores each object together
      with the number of occurances. Methods are provided to get the number of
      occurances, and to add and remove a certain number of that object.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.Buffer}
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A new <code>Collection</code> subinterface that allows objects to be removed
      in some well-defined order. Methods enable the next item to be peeked and removed.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.BidiMap}
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A new <code>Map</code> subinterface that allows lookup from key to value and
      from value to key with equal ease.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.OrderedMap}
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A new <code>Map</code> subinterface that is used when a map has an order, but is
      not sorted. Methods enable bidriectional iteration through the map.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.MapIterator}
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A new <code>Iterator</code> subinterface specially designed for maps. This iterator
      avoids the need for entrySet iteration of a map, and is simpler to use.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.ResettableIterator}
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A new <code>Iterator</code> subinterface that allows the iteration to be reset back
      to the start. Many iterators in this library have this functionality.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.Closure}<br />
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.Predicate}<br />
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.Transformer}<br />
      {@link org.apache.commons.collections.Factory}<br />
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      A group of <i>functor</i> interfaces that provide plugin behaviour to various
      collections and utilities.
    </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
     In addition to the interfaces, there are many implementations.
     Consult each subpackage for full details of these.
  </p>
     
  <h4>Version 3.0</h4>
  <p>
     Commons-Collections was originally created as a place to share collection
     implementations created in various places around Jakarta. As a result, there
     was no clear design or structure to the component. As from this 3.0 release,
     that changes with a clear, consistent package structure being used
  </p>
  <p>
     As a result of the new structure, several classes have moved packages.
     When moving from a previous release to this one it is important to check all your code.
     Some implementations that were moved were also optimised, and may contain API changes.
  </p>
  <p>
     In addition to the new package structure, it was determined that collections was
     getting too large.
     As a result, two new code donations - primitive collections and event
     notification collections - have been separated into their own projects within commons.
     Primitives has already released a version 1.0, while Events resides in the sandbox at present.
