/**
 * UnboundedFifoBuffer is a <strong>very</strong> efficient buffer implementation.
 * According to performance testing, it exhibits a constant access time, but it
 * also outperforms ArrayList when used for the same purpose.
 * <p>
 * The removal order of an <code>UnboundedFifoBuffer</code> is based on the insertion
 * order; elements are removed in the same order in which they were added.
 * The iteration order is the same as the removal order.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #remove()} and {@link #get()} operations perform in constant time.
 * The {@link #add(Object)} operation performs in amortized constant time.  All
 * other operations perform in linear time or worse.
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation is not synchronized.  The following can be
 * used to provide synchronized access to your <code>UnboundedFifo</code>:
 * <pre>
 *   Buffer fifo = BufferUtils.synchronizedBuffer(new UnboundedFifo());
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This buffer prevents null objects from being added.
