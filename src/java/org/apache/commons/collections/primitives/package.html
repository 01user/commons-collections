<BODY>
Contains collection implementations that use primitive elements.  Currently
the package offers lists of primitive elements that are backed by primitive
arrays, offering substantial memory and performance savings.<p>

There are generally two layers of abstract per primitive list type.  The
first layer, implemented by the <Code>Abstract*List</Code> classes, provides
default implementations for all of the <Code>java.util.List</Code> methods
and most of their primitive counterparts.  The second layer of abstraction,
implemented by the <Code>Abstract*ArrayList</Code> classes, provides 
additional method signatures for manipulating a list that's backed by a
primitive array.<p>

Note that these layers are not provided for <Code>FloatArrayList</Code>,
and that many primitive types are not represented in this package at all;
these inconsistencies may be addressed by a future release.
