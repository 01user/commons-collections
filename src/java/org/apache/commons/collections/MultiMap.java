/** 
 * This is simply a Map with slightly different semantics.
 * <p>
 * A <code>MultiMap</code> is a Map with slightly different semantics.
 * Putting a value into the map will add the value to a Collection at that
 * key. Getting a value will always return a Collection, holding all the
 * values put to that key. This implementation uses an ArrayList as the 
 * collection.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * MultiMap mhm = new MultiHashMap();
 * mhm.put(key, "A");
 * mhm.put(key, "B");
 * mhm.put(key, "C");
 * Collection coll = (Collection) mhm.get(key);</pre>
 * <p>
 * <code>coll</code> will be a list containing "A", "B", "C".
