/**
 * <p>A ComparatorChain is a Comparator that wraps one or
 * more Comparators in sequence.  The ComparatorChain
 * calls each Comparator in sequence until either 1)
 * any single Comparator returns a non-zero result
 * (and that result is then returned),
 * or 2) the ComparatorChain is exhausted (and zero is
 * returned).  This type of sorting is very similar
 * to multi-column sorting in SQL, and this class
 * allows Java classes to emulate that kind of behaviour
 * when sorting a List.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To further facilitate SQL-like sorting, the order of
 * any single Comparator in the list can be reversed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Calling a method that adds new Comparators or
 * changes the ascend/descend sort <i>after compare(Object,
 * Object) has been called</i> will result in an
 * UnsupportedOperationException.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instances of ComparatorChain are not synchronized.
 * The class is not thread-safe at construction time, but
 * it <i>is</i> thread-safe to perform multiple comparisons
 * after all the setup operations are complete.</p>
