     * {@link org.apache.commons.collections.observed.standard.StandardModificationListener}
     * interface and pass it in as the second parameter.
     * <p>
     * Internally, an <code>ObservableBuffer</code> relies on a {@link ModificationHandler}.
     * The handler receives all the events and processes them, typically by
     * calling listeners. Different handler implementations can be plugged in
     * to provide a flexible event system.
     * <p>
     * The handler implementation is determined by the listener parameter via
     * the registered factories. The listener may be a manually configured 
     * <code>ModificationHandler</code> instance.
     * <p>
     * The listener is defined as an Object for maximum flexibility.
     * It does not have to be a listener in the classic JavaBean sense.
     * It is entirely up to the factory and handler as to how the parameter
     * is interpretted. An IllegalArgumentException is thrown if no suitable
     * handler can be found for this listener.
     * <p>
