<p>
This package contains collection decorators that allow you to register to listen
to changes in the underlying collection. A standard listener based event system
is supplied, but alternatives can be added, see ModificationHandler.
<p>
Each decorator can be constructed using a static <code>decorate()</code> method on
the ObservedXxx class. They can also be constructed from the <code>XxxUtils</code>
class (where Xxx is the collection type).
<p>
<code>List observedList = ObservedList.decorate(new ArrayList(), listener);</code>
<br />OR<br />
<code>List observedList = ListUtils.observedList(new ArrayList(), listener);</code>
